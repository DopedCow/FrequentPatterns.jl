Returns a Dict with the labels as keys and the support (count) as values.

Run ECLAT algorithm on the transactions db and return rules above thresholds.

Note that while you can set minimum support to something less, it hardly makes
sense as this would include items which only occurs once or not at all. In both
cases, it would lead to useless rules.
